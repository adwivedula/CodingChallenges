/**
 * Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,
 * add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).
 * The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.
 * Example:
 * If the vector has [1, 2, 3]
 * the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]
 * as 123 + 1 = 124.
 *
 *  NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer.
 *  For example, for this problem, following are some good questions to ask :
 *  Q : Can the input have 0’s before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
 *  A : For the purpose of this question, YES
 *  Q : Can the output have 0’s before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
 *  A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.
 *
 *
 *  Hint 1:
 *  First convince yourself that constructing numbers and then adding 1 will not work.
 *  The number of digits can be really high ( Imagine 1000 - 10000 digits ).
 *  Now, lets look at how we will add 1.
 *  Try to think of how you would add 1 on paper. Start from the last digit, and maintain carry.
 *
 *  Hint 2:
 *
 *  There are 2 cases with adding one.
 *  Case 1:
 *  The number of digits after adding 1 remains the same.
 *  This is the easy case. Simulate the mathematical process of adding one maintaining carry from the digit.
 *  Case 2:
 *  The number of digits increases by 1 when adding.
 *  This causes some complication as you would have to shift all digits by 1 to make space for the new digit in the most significant position.
 *  Tip :Try reversing the digits for the addition. Reverse them back after getting the result.
 *
 *
 *  Reverse the digits of the number to make your life easier.
 *  Maintain a carry which is initialized to 1 ( Denoting that we need to add one to the number ).
 *  Run a loop on the digit array ( which is now reversed ), and add carry to the current digit.
 *  If the digit D exceeds 10 on doing so, store the last digit in current position ( D % 10 ), and make carry = rest of the digits ( D / 10 ).
 *  Continue the process till you have covered all the digits.
 *  Now if at the end, carry = 0, we are done, and we can return the array.
 *  If not, we need to add one more digit, with carry in it.
